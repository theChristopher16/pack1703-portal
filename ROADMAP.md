# Pack Families Portal - Complete Project Roadmap

## üéØ Project Overview
**Build Request:** Pack Families Portal ‚Äî React + Firestore (No Accounts)

**Product Summary:** Build a beautiful, highly interactive, mobile-first React web app that serves as a one-stop hub for pack families. It should expose dates, locations, times, maps, packing lists, announcements, live updates, and enable two-way submission (RSVPs, feedback, questions, volunteer sign-ups) without user accounts. The app must be fast, offline-capable (PWA), accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA), and secure with least-privilege data flows.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Selection & Rationale
**Firestore (Firebase) as the database. Reasons:**
- **Realtime updates** for event changes, announcements, and RSVP counts
- **No-SQL document model** fits event/seasonal content well
- **Fine-grained Security Rules** for read-mostly public content + restricted write collections
- **Anonymous use pattern** supported via App Check and Callable Cloud Functions with token/captcha gating for writes
- **Do not use SQL** unless unavoidable
- **Do not require user accounts**

## üõ†Ô∏è Complete Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React 18** + **TypeScript** + **Vite** + **React Router**
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) with Firestore adapters
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components + lucide-react icons
- **Maps**: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles (no API key); GeoJSON support
- **Calendar**: FullCalendar (or similar) with ICS export
- **PWA**: Service worker + manifest; offline cache core routes and read-only data
- **i18n**: react-i18next (baseline English; structure ready for future locales)

### Backend & Services
- **Data**: Firebase Firestore (modular v9 SDK), Firebase App Check
- **Serverless**: Firebase Cloud Functions (callable endpoints) for write/mutate paths and server-side ICS feed generation
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright smoke tests
- **Lint/Format**: ESLint (typescript, react, jsx-a11y) + Prettier
- **CI checks**: typecheck, lint, unit tests

## üé® Visual/UX Theme
### Aesthetic
- **"Solarpunk-ish"** (optimistic nature + tech): warm yellows/greens, subtle gradients, rounded cards, light shadows

### Design Tokens
- **Primary**: #FFD166 (sun)
- **Secondary**: #06D6A0 (green)
- **Accent**: #118AB2
- **Surface**: #F7FAFC
- **Text**: #243B53
- **Respect prefers-color-scheme**; provide dark mode variant

## üöÄ Core Features (Public, No Account)

### 1. Events Hub
- **List + calendar views**; filter by "Pack-wide," "Den," "Camping," "Overnight," "Service"
- **Event detail page**: date/time, location (map pin), address, parking notes, packing list, fees (if any), point of contact (generic pack email or form, not a personal email), attached PDFs/images
- **Actions**:
  - **"Add to Calendar"** ‚Üí generate ICS (single event) client-side
  - **"Subscribe to Feed"** ‚Üí serve ICS feed via Cloud Function (pack-wide or den-specific)
  - **"Directions"** ‚Üí link to map app with proper lat/lng
  - **"Share"** ‚Üí Web Share API where available

### 2. Announcements / Live Updates
- **Chronological feed**; pin important items; inline attachments; supports "last updated" timestamp banner

### 3. Two-Way Submissions (No Account)
- **RSVP / Headcount**: family name (free-text), number attending, optional email/phone (minimally requested; NOT required), comments/allergies
- **Submit via Callable Function that**:
  - Validates input schema
  - Scrubs PII (normalize, trim; block HTML)
  - Hashes IP (salted) for rate limiting (store only hash)
  - Enforces per-event rate limit (e.g., 5/min/IP-hash)
  - Tags submission with server timestamp and UA summary
- **Feedback / Questions**: category (bug, suggestion, general), message body, optional contact
- **Volunteer Sign-ups**: role picklist (e.g., check-in, gear, food), quantity needed vs. claimed; conflict-aware "claim" operation through Function

### 4. Resources
- **Packing lists** (camping, overnights)
- **Quick links**: medical forms, photo policy, FAQs
- **"What to expect" guides** for each event type

### 5. Locations Directory
- **Card list of common venues** with map, drive time notes, gate codes (if any ‚Üí store as "PrivateNote" and hide from public; show only if "isPublicNote: true"), parking diagrams

### 6. Smart Utilities
- **Weather glance** (no API key): pull 48h forecast from Open-Meteo via serverless proxy (Functions) to avoid CORS/key issues; cache 10 min; show only minimal fields (temp range, precip chance, UV)
- **ICS feed builder**: user selects Dens/categories ‚Üí returns a tailored ICS feed URL
- **Printable one-pager per month**: generated client-side to PDF
- **Offline mode**: cache "next 30 days of events," locations, packing lists, and the announcements index

### 7. Accessibility & Performance
- **WCAG 2.2 AA**: focus states, semantic landmarks, color contrast, ARIA where needed
- **CLS < 0.1, LCP < 2.5s** on 4G mid-range device

## üóÉÔ∏è Complete Data Model (Firestore ‚Äî top-level collections)

**Use kebab-case IDs and keep documents small.**

### `/seasons/{seasonId}`
```typescript
{
  name: string        // e.g., "2025‚Äì2026"
  startDate: ts
  endDate: ts
  isActive: boolean
}
```

### `/events/{eventId}`
```typescript
{
  seasonId: ref(/seasons)
  title: string
  category: "pack" | "den" | "campout" | "overnight" | "service" | "meeting"
  start: ts
  end: ts
  locationId: ref(/locations)
  description: string (markdown allowed; sanitize on render)
  packingList: string[]        // keys into /lists or inline strings
  attachments: {name,url,type}[]
  rsvpEnabled: boolean
  capacity: number | null
  visibility: "public" | "link-only"
  denTags: string[]            // e.g., ["Wolf","Bear"]
  updatedAt: ts
  createdAt: ts
}
```

### `/locations/{locationId}`
```typescript
{
  name: string
  address: string
  geo: { lat: number, lng: number }
  notesPublic: string
  notesPrivate: string         // never sent to client
  parking: { imageUrl?: string, text?: string }
}
```

### `/announcements/{postId}`
```typescript
{
  title: string
  body: string (markdown)
  pinned: boolean
  eventId?: ref(/events)
  createdAt: ts
  updatedAt: ts
}
```

### `/lists/{listId}`
```typescript
{
  title: string
  items: { label: string, optional?: boolean }[]
}
```

### `/submissions/{submissionId}` (write-only via Cloud Function)
```typescript
{
  kind: "rsvp" | "feedback" | "question" | "volunteer"
  payload: object                  // validated server-side; PII minimized
  eventId?: ref(/events)
  meta: { ua: string, ipHash: string, createdAt: ts }
}
```

### `/volunteer-needs/{needId}`
```typescript
{
  eventId: ref(/events)
  role: string
  needed: number
  claimed: number
}
```

**Important**: Any sensitive/private fields (e.g., notesPrivate) must never be readable by the client. Store them in a parallel private collection if needed (e.g., /private/locations/{id}) and only expose through admin tooling, not this app.

## üîí Firestore Security Rules (high-level)

### Reads
- Allow read on `/events`, `/announcements`, `/locations`, `/lists`, `/seasons` where visibility == "public" (or not present)
- Deny any field that's private (don't store it in readable docs)

### Writes
- Client documents are never written directly to first-class collections
- Only allow Callable Functions to write to `/submissions/*` and to increment volunteer claims:
  - Validate schemas (length limits, regex for phone/email if provided)
  - Strip HTML, block links in message bodies
  - Add createdAt server timestamp
  - Add salted ipHash and ua for rate limiting and abuse detection
  - App Check required for callable endpoints
  - Rate limiting inside Functions (token bucket per ipHash + endpoint)

## ‚ö° Cloud Functions (Callable + HTTP)

### Core Functions
- **`submitRSVP(eventId, form)`**: validate, capacity check, write `/submissions`, update event RSVP counters in a separate aggregate doc `/event-stats/{eventId}` (so reads are cheap)
- **`submitFeedback(form)`**: store write-only, optional email notification to pack mailbox
- **`claimVolunteerRole(needId, count)`**: atomic increment with upper bound guard
- **`icsFeed(queryParams)`**: generate ICS for filters (season, categories, denTags)
- **`weatherProxy(lat, lng)`**: fetch from Open-Meteo, cache in memory/Firestore for 10 min, return minimal JSON
- **`moderationDigest()`**: daily summary email of new submissions (counts + samples, no raw PII)

## üó∫Ô∏è Critical Pages / Routes

### Core Routes
- **`/`** Home dashboard: next events, announcements ticker, quick links, weather glance
- **`/events`** Calendar + list; filters and search
- **`/events/:id`** Detail with map, ICS add, RSVP form, packing list
- **`/locations`** Card directory with map and venue details
- **`/resources`** Packing lists, PDFs, FAQs
- **`/volunteer`** Open roles; claim flow
- **`/feedback`** General feedback form
- **`/*`** 404 with quick navigation

## üß© Components (examples)

### Core Components
- **EventCard**, **EventCalendar**, **EventFilters**, **RSVPForm**, **FeedbackForm**
- **VolunteerRoleCard**, **LocationMap**, **PackingList**, **AnnouncementCard**
- **WeatherGlance**, **ICSButton**, **ShareButton**, **Toast**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### Core Principles
- **No accounts**. All write operations go through callable Functions with:
  - App Check (reCAPTCHA Enterprise or DeviceCheck) required
  - Input schema validation (zod)
  - Content sanitization (DOMPurify on render, server-side strip)
  - IP hashing with per-endpoint throttles; store only salted hash
  - PII optional and minimal; never required for basic use
  - CSP headers, SRI for third-party CDN assets (if any), dependency audit

## üì± PWA & Offline

### Offline Capabilities
- Cache shell routes + "next 30 days of events & locations"
- Queue write attempts (submissions) and retry when online (background sync)
- Provide "offline banner" and disable actions that truly require network

## ü§ñ Automation & Year-Over-Year Rollover

### Season Management
- Script/Function: duplicate a season (clone last season's structure, carry forward canonical locations, create empty events template)
- Data is 100% database-driven: changing seasons/events/locations requires no code changes

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (must pass)

### Performance & Functionality
1. **Landing loads < 2.5s LCP** on mid-range phone over 4G; Lighthouse PWA installable
2. **Events appear in list + calendar**; ICS for single event and feed both work
3. **RSVP/Feedback/Volunteer submissions succeed** without an account; rate limiting demonstrable
4. **Offline mode**: previously viewed events and next 30 days are available; submissions queue and retry

### Security & Compliance
5. **Firestore Rules block direct writes** to core collections; only Functions can mutate
6. **A11y**: keyboard navigation, focus states, landmarks, semantic HTML, color contrast checks pass
7. **Theming**: solar-punk palette, dark mode available
8. **No secrets in client bundle**; private notes never readable from client

## üì¶ Deliverables

### Complete Repository
- **Full repo**: `/src` React app, `/functions` Firebase Functions, `/firebase.json` config, scripts
- **Seed data JSON** for seasons/events/locations/lists
- **README** with setup (App Check, env, deployment)
- **Basic admin doc**: how to add season, create event, update announcements
