# Quick Fix: Enable Google Sign-In (Easier Alternative)

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue
Apple Sign-In requires Apple Developer credentials ($99/year). Let's enable Google Sign-In first as it's free and easier.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Google Sign-In Setup:

### Step 1: Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase
1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pack-1703-portal/authentication/providers
2. **Click "Authentication"** in the left sidebar
3. **Go to "Sign-in method"** tab
4. **Find "Google"** in the provider list
5. **Click "Google"** and toggle **"Enable"** to **ON**
6. **Add your email** as the project support email
7. **Save**

### Step 2: Test Google Sign-In
1. **Go to your app**: https://pack-1703-portal.web.app
2. **Click "Sign in with Google"**
3. **Sign in with your Google account**
4. **You should be signed in successfully!**

## ðŸŽ¨ Button Styling Fixed
I've updated the button styling to look more official:
- Apple button: Solid black background (Apple's official style)
- Google button: White background with Google colors
- All buttons: Proper shadows and hover effects

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:
1. **Test Google Sign-In** (should work immediately)
2. **If you want Apple Sign-In**: Follow the Apple Developer setup guide
3. **Or stick with Google Sign-In**: It's free and works great!

## ðŸ“ž Quick Test:
Try signing in with Google first - it should work right away without any additional setup!
