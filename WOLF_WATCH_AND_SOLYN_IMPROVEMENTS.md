4. **Content Analysis** - Analyzes fetched content for scout-relevant information
5. **Automatic Creation** - Creates events and announcements from extracted data

### Security Features

- **Domain Blocking** - Blocks access to local/private IP ranges
- **Content Sanitization** - Removes scripts and HTML tags
- **Size Limits** - 500KB content limit per URL
- **Timeout Protection** - 10-second timeout per request
- **Content Type Validation** - Only allows HTML/text content

### Processing Flow
