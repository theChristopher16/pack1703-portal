# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX FOR RSVP VIEWER PERMISSIONS

## Problem Confirmed
- ‚úÖ Admin user exists with correct role (`root`) and permissions
- ‚úÖ Firestore rules are correctly configured
- ‚úÖ Data exists (7 RSVPs for the event)
- ‚ùå **Client-side authentication token doesn't have updated custom claims**

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Run This in Browser Console

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Copy and paste this code:

```javascript
// RSVP Viewer Permissions Fix
console.log('üîß Fixing RSVP Viewer Permissions...');

const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
if (!user) {
  console.error('‚ùå No user signed in');
} else {
  console.log('‚úÖ User:', user.email);
  
  // Force refresh the authentication token
  user.getIdToken(true).then(() => {
    console.log('‚úÖ Token refreshed successfully!');
    console.log('üéâ The RSVP viewer should now work!');
    console.log('Try clicking the "Refresh" button in the RSVP modal.');
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error('‚ùå Token refresh failed:', error);
  });
}
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix

1. After running the console script, click the "Refresh" button in the RSVP modal
2. The RSVP viewer should now load the 7 RSVPs successfully
3. You should see the correct statistics and be able to export the data

### Alternative: Sign Out and Back In

If the console script doesn't work:
1. Sign out of the application completely
2. Sign back in
3. Your authentication token will be refreshed automatically
4. Try the RSVP viewer again

## Why This Happened

The issue occurred because:
1. The Firestore rules were updated to recognize `root` role users
2. Your user account already had the correct `role: "root"` custom claims
3. However, your browser's authentication token was cached and didn't include the updated claims
4. Firestore rules couldn't recognize you as an admin with the old token

## Verification

After the fix, you should see:
- ‚úÖ 7 total RSVPs
- ‚úÖ Correct attendee counts
- ‚úÖ Den breakdowns
- ‚úÖ CSV export functionality
- ‚úÖ No permission errors in console

## Prevention

This issue shouldn't happen again because:
- ‚úÖ Firestore rules now properly recognize all admin roles
- ‚úÖ Custom claims are correctly set
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive unit tests are in place
- ‚úÖ The system will work correctly for all future admin users
