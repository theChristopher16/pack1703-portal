# GCP Migration Validation Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy to validate that the GCP migration from the previous VM-based infrastructure was successful.

## Test Objectives
- Verify all GCP resources are properly deployed and configured
- Validate Cloud Functions are working correctly
- Confirm Firebase Hosting is serving the React app
- Test Firestore database connectivity and performance
- Validate monitoring and alerting systems
- Compare performance and costs with previous infrastructure
- Ensure security and compliance requirements are met

## Test Categories

### 1. Infrastructure Validation
- **GCP Project Status**: Verify project exists, billing enabled, APIs enabled
- **Firebase Project**: Confirm Firebase project setup, web apps, hosting sites
- **Firestore Database**: Validate database exists, indexes created, security rules applied
- **Cloud Storage**: Verify buckets exist with proper CORS and lifecycle policies
- **Cloud Functions**: Check service accounts, IAM roles, and function deployments
- **Monitoring**: Validate alert policies, notification channels, and dashboards
- **Secrets**: Confirm Secret Manager secrets are properly configured

### 2. API Testing
- **Cloud Functions Endpoints**: Test all function endpoints with various payloads
- **Authentication**: Verify Firebase Auth integration
- **Data Validation**: Test input validation and error handling
- **Performance**: Measure response times and throughput
- **Load Testing**: Simulate realistic user traffic patterns

### 3. Application Testing
- **React App Deployment**: Verify app builds and deploys to Firebase Hosting
- **User Workflows**: Test complete user journeys (RSVP, volunteer signup, etc.)
- **Admin Functions**: Validate admin panel functionality
- **Responsiveness**: Test on various devices and screen sizes
- **Browser Compatibility**: Verify cross-browser functionality

### 4. Performance & Cost Analysis
- **Response Times**: Compare with previous VM-based performance
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Cost Comparison**: Analyze GCP costs vs. previous infrastructure
- **Scalability**: Test under various load conditions

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation
1. Run `gcp-infrastructure-tests.sh` to verify all GCP resources
2. Check for any failed resource deployments
3. Validate configuration matches OpenTofu specifications

### Phase 2: API Testing
1. Deploy Cloud Functions using `deploy-and-test-cloud-functions.sh`
2. Test all endpoints with valid and invalid data
3. Perform load testing to identify bottlenecks

### Phase 3: Application Testing
1. Deploy React app using `deploy-and-test-react-app.sh`
2. Test user workflows and admin functions
3. Validate responsive design and browser compatibility

### Phase 4: Performance & Cost Analysis
1. Run `cost-performance-analysis.sh` to gather metrics
2. Compare with baseline measurements
3. Generate performance report

## Success Criteria
- All GCP resources deployed successfully
- Cloud Functions respond within 2 seconds under normal load
- React app loads in under 3 seconds
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Cost increase stays within 20% of previous infrastructure
- All user workflows function correctly
- Monitoring and alerting systems operational

## Test Scripts
- `gcp-infrastructure-tests.sh`: Infrastructure validation
- `deploy-and-test-cloud-functions.sh`: Cloud Functions testing
- `deploy-and-test-react-app.sh`: React app testing
- `cost-performance-analysis.sh`: Performance and cost analysis
- `run-all-gcp-tests.sh`: Master test runner

## Reporting
Each test phase generates detailed logs and metrics. The master test runner provides a comprehensive summary report with pass/fail status for each test category.
