# Quick Start: Fixing Unapproved Users

## What Happened? 🤔

**You discovered users in your authentication database who never went through the approval process:**
- Stephen Tadlock
- Wei Gao
- Possibly others

## Why Did This Happen? 🔍

Users who signed in with **Google** (or other social providers) bypassed the approval system entirely. This was a bug in the code where social login users were automatically approved instead of going through the proper workflow.

## What Was Fixed? ✅

1. **Updated the social login flow** to require approval for all new users
2. **New users now:**
   - Get created with "pending" status
   - Trigger email notification to cubmaster@sfpack1703.com
   - Are signed out immediately
   - Cannot access the system until approved

3. **First user exception:** The very first user (root/super admin) is still auto-approved

## What You Need to Do Now 🎯

### Step 1: Run the Fix Script

This script will help you review and fix existing users who bypassed the approval system.

```bash
cd /Users/christophersmith/Documents/GitHub/pack1703-portal
node scripts/fix-unapproved-users.js
```

### Step 2: Choose How to Handle Existing Users

**Option 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended)**
- Reviews each user one by one
- You decide what to do with each user
- Best for careful review

**Option 2: Batch Approve All**
- Approves all users at once
- Quick but less careful
- Use if you trust all existing users

**Option 3: Batch Set to Pending**
- Sets all users to pending status
- They'll need to go through approval again
- Most secure but may annoy users

### Step 3: What to Do with Each User

For **Stephen Tadlock and Wei Gao**, you have options:

**Option A: Approve them**
```
Action? [a/p/r/s/q]: a
```
- ✅ Gives them proper approval metadata
- ✅ They can continue using the system
- ✅ You can see who approved them and when

**Option B: Set to pending**
```
Action? [a/p/r/s/q]: p
```
- ⏳ Requires them to go through approval again
- ⏳ They won't be able to access the system until you approve
- ⏳ You'll get an email notification

**Option C: Remove them**
```
Action? [a/p/r/s/q]: r
```
- 🗑️ Completely removes them from the system
- 🗑️ They'd need to sign up again
- ⚠️ Use with caution

**Option D: Skip**
```
Action? [a/p/r/s/q]: s
```
- ⏭️ Leaves them as-is
- ⏭️ No changes made

## Example Session

```bash
$ node scripts/fix-unapproved-users.js
