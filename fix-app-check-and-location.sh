echo "=========================================="
echo ""

echo "üìã ISSUE DIAGNOSIS:"
echo "- App Check enforcement is enabled in Firebase Console"
echo "- Frontend has debug token but Console still blocks requests"
echo "- Location updates succeed but don't appear due to blocked reads"
echo ""

echo "üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION STEPS:"
echo ""
echo "1. DISABLE APP CHECK ENFORCEMENT IN FIREBASE CONSOLE:"
echo "   a) Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pack1703-portal"
echo "   b) Click 'App Check' in left sidebar"
echo "   c) Click 'APIs' tab"
echo "   d) Find 'Cloud Firestore' and toggle OFF enforcement"
echo "   e) Find 'Cloud Functions' and toggle OFF enforcement"
echo "   f) Click 'Save'"
echo ""

echo "2. VERIFY LOCATION DATA FLOW:"
echo "   - Event updates are working (console shows success)"
echo "   - LocationSelector is saving locationId correctly"
echo "   - Issue is in reading/displaying updated data"
echo ""

echo "3. ALTERNATIVE: TEMPORARY WORKAROUND"
echo "   - Clear browser cache completely"
echo "   - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)"
echo "   - Try editing event again"
echo ""

echo "4. LONG-TERM FIX:"
echo "   - Configure reCAPTCHA v3 properly"
echo "   - Re-enable App Check with proper tokens"
echo "   - This provides better security than debug tokens"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ QUICK TEST AFTER FIXING:"
echo "1. Edit the 'Double Lake Recreation Area Family Campout' event"
echo "2. Select 'U.S.S. Stewart' from LocationSelector"
echo "3. Save the event"
echo "4. Check if location appears on event card (should show 'U.S.S. Stewart' not 'TBD')"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "- No more 'access control checks' errors in console"
echo "- Location updates appear immediately after saving"
echo "- Weather data loads properly (API key is now valid)"
echo "- All Firestore operations work smoothly"
echo ""

echo "üîç DEBUG INFO:"
echo "- Your OpenWeather API key is working (no more 401 errors)"
echo "- Event update succeeds (console shows 'Event update result: {success: true}')"
echo "- Location enrichment fetches 1 location correctly"
echo "- Issue is App Check blocking the read operations after updates"
