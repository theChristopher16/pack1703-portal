## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: What happens if payment fails?**  
A: User sees error message, can retry immediately. RSVP is saved but marked "pending payment".

**Q: Can users pay later?**  
A: Not currently supported. They must complete payment during RSVP process.

**Q: How do I issue refunds?**  
A: Process refund through Square dashboard, then update payment record in Firestore.

**Q: What about partial payments?**  
A: Not currently supported. Full payment required upfront.

**Q: Can I change the price after creating the event?**  
A: Yes, but only affects new RSVPs. Existing RSVPs keep original price.
