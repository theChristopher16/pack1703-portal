## ðŸŽ¨ Issue 2: Button Styling
The buttons don't look official because they need Apple's official styling guidelines.

The buttons should follow Apple's design guidelines:
- Black background (#000000)
- White text
- Apple logo on the left
- Proper padding and border radius

## ðŸš€ After Setup:
1. **Test Apple Sign-In** on your live app
2. **The buttons will look official** once properly configured
3. **"Sign Up Not Completed" error will be resolved**
